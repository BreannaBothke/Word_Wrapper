##Application Requirements:

####Take Home Test

###Description:

>You are working on a word processing application and want to be able to take a string and insert line breaks at just the right places
so that it will fit into a column of a given length. You want to break lines at word boundaries.

This exercise is to implement the following method:

```
    public class WordWrapper {
        public static String wrap(String text, int maxLineLength) {
            // your implementation here
        }
    }
```
>1.The wrap function should break the text into lines no longer than the max length

>2.The wrap function should break the text on word boundaries by replacing a space with a newline character

>3.The wrap function should output the resulting text

###Requirements

>* Please complete the exercise in Java
>* Please submit your code in a local git repo (zipped and emailed, not on github etc)
>* Please use Test Driven Development
>* Commit your changes for each test so we can see your progress as you code the solution
